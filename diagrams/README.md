# Project Diagrams (Mermaid with Font Awesome)

This folder contains various diagrams created using Mermaid, a popular diagramming language. These diagrams leverage Font Awesome icons to enhance visual clarity and effectively illustrate the project's key concepts and findings presented in the report.

The diagrams provide a visual complement to the written text, allowing for a deeper understanding of the project.

Diagrams Include:

- Flowcharts to depict processes and workflows.
- Sequence diagrams to visualize interactions between different parts of the system.
- Diagrams to depict the project's architecture

The diagrams were maid with Mermaid.js and Font Awesome for the icons.

We recommend using the report in conjunction with these diagrams for a comprehensive understanding of the project.
