# Angular.js Ionic App with Capacitor-NFC Plugin

This project is an Ionic mobile application built with Angular.js that leverages the Capacitor-NFC plugin for Near Field Communication (NFC) functionalities.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Ionic application structure, with the following key directories:

- `src`: Contains the Angular.js application code, including components, services, pages, and directives.
